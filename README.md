# Node.js boilerplate
Node.js (v6.9.1+) boilerplate to start quickly your from-scratch projects.

Use some ECMAScript 6 standards.

## Details
This boilerplate contains:

- Express.js, for your web server.
- Logs to trace HTTP requests and Node.js messages.
- Units tests with Mocha and others modules.
- Gulp, awesome to build your production package.

## Development install
Install dependencies with `npm i` command.

Run the server with `npm run dev` command.

### Note
The `Harmony` branch of UglifyJS2 is used to be compatible with ECMAScript standards.

Check the `package.json` if necessary.
